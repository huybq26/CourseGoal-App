# CourseGoal-App
An android app to take note and list the goals for each course. <br>
User can add, modify, delete their tasks and notes with one touch.

In order to run this app, you need to install Expo CLI and have Android Studio ready with an Emulator. Follow the guides below:

Installing Expo CLI
### `npm install --global expo-cli`
Verify that the installation was successful by running expo whoami. You're not logged in yet, so you will see "Not logged in". You can create an account by running expo register if you like, or if you have one already run expo login, but you also don't need an account to get started.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo install` 

to install the required dependecies

### `expo start`

to run the app in development mode

Run the Android Emulator directly in Android Studio

    Click File > Settings > Tools > Emulator (or Android Studio > Preferences > Tools > Emulator on macOS), then select Launch in a tool window and click OK.
    If the Emulator window didn't automatically appear, open it by clicking View > Tool Windows > Emulator.
Then go to the terminal, press 'a' to open in your emulator android, or you can use your phone to scan the QR code in development mode.
